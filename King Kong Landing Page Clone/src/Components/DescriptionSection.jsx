                <p>Dear business builder,</p>
                <p>We get it.</p>
                <p>Growing a business is hard. Really f*cking hard.</p>
                <p>Stressed and sleeping like a teething two-year old.</p>
                <p>As your hair goes fifty shades of grey from all the uncertainty.</p>
                <p>And to top it off.</p>
                <p>You&rsquo;re being pulled in a bazillion different directions.</p>
                <p>Ohmygawd!</p>
                <p>Should I blog? Start a podcast? Build a personal brand?</p>
                <p>Document my whole flippin&rsquo; life on instagram?</p>
                <p>What about chatbots?</p>
                <p>Should I run some ads?</p>
                <p>Drop $3k on a logo?</p>
                <p>Post on LinkedIn five times per day?</p>
                <p>*somebody please pull out my eyelashes*</p>
                <p>Look, most entrepreneurs have a bad case of &rsquo;shiny object syndrome&rsquo;...</p>
                <p>Mixed with a scoop of ADD... and a sprinkle of "I can do everything".</p>
                <p>And they end up doing a lilttle bit of this... a little bit of that.</p>
                <p>Soon, they&rsquo;re screaming at their Macbook with all the things they "have to" do.</p>
                <p>We call this shit show a rats nest.</p>
                <p>Also known as hell.</p>
                <p>It&rsquo;s hot and muggy there.</p>
                <p>And we&rsquo;d rather sub scorpion chillies in our eyes than operate a business that way.</p>
                <p>But this isn&rsquo;t about us... It&rsquo;s about you.</p>
                <p>You&rsquo;re reading this right now because, in some way shape or form, your business isn&rsquo;t where you want it to be.</p>
                <p>Or maybe you&rsquo;re flying... and you simply want more.</p>
                <p>More security.</p>
                <p>More money.</p>
                <p><strong>More freedom.</strong></p>
                <p>More memories.</p>
                <p><strong>More time with your family.</strong></p>
                <p>More business-class flights with your spouse to places that result in more sand between your toes.</p>
                <p>Whatever it is for you...</p>
                <p>it all starts by "choosing your own adventure" below...</p>
                <p><strong>*cue angels singing*</strong></p>
